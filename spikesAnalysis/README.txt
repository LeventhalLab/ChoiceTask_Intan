MATLAB repository compiled by Ryan Lash 2025 for analysis of single unit thalamic spikes during choice task



spikeQuality: Bombcell(created by Julie Fabre PhD) repository with specified parameters for recording from the motor thalamus. See read me for more info. 

psthRastersPlotting: PsthRaster_Loop_RL.m generates psth and rasters plots of specified trial features. Credit to Kennedy Knopf for assisting in this

helpers: mostly navigation and file loading tools needed for analysis. Credit: Jennifer Magnusson PhD

choiceTaskTrialStructure: Loads and generates trial structure for choice task behavior
