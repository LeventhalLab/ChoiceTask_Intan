% calculate average field potentials for a single trial type in a session
% and plot the data.

% trialRanges_final contains the vectors with beginning time point row 1,
% end of the time point row 4 e.g write code as [1 4]. During these time
% points calculate the average of lfp_NNsite_order in a matrix

%should be a 64 column matrix (64 channels).

t_win = trialRanges_final([1 4],1);
